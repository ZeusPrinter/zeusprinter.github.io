          <h1>Let's build a rockin' 3D printer!</h1>
          <br><br>
          <h2>Some parts we're going to need:</h2>
	  <h3>an extruder:</h3>
	  <body>
		<text class="indent">This is the component that melts and places the filament. This part is relatively cheap at $12 (This is the price I've found on Ebay).</text>
	  </body>
	  <br><br>
	  <h3>Filaments:</h3>
	  <body>
		<text class="indent">Speaking of filaments, we're going to need to purchase one (or many). There are many different types, sizes, and properties for each filament. Just to go through a few:</text>
		<br><br>
		<li class="indent">ABS - This is a really good, strong plastic, it's really the simplest plastic.</li>
		<br>
		<li class="indent">PLA - This is biodegradable plastic. It has a lower melting point than ABS, which means it's less likely to warp, and it's eco friendly!</li>
		<br>
		<li class="indent">Wood - Interestingly this is, in my opinion, the most interesting filament. It feels like wood, smells like wood, sands like wood, and even acts like wood. It might even taste like wood (we're still trying to get Joel to taste it)</li>
	  </body>
	  <br><br>
	  <h3>an arduino of some kind:</h3>
	  <body>
		<text class="indent">The original Zeus Printer uses an arduino uno to drive everything, This part will run you about $20. If you don't have/purchase an arduino uno, then you'll have to go and edit the software's pin header file to be the specific pin setup of your arduino. If you're not software technically minded, then don't worry, this is really easy, just like editing a text file.</text>
	  </body>
	  <br><br>
	  <h3>You might need a power supply:</h3>
	  <body>
	  	<text class="indent">The reason behind this is depending on the amount of stepper motors, arduinos (no one said we had to stop at just one), and other power drawing sources, we could need a lot more power than could run through one arduino.</text>
